## Introduction

This Lab Session will introduce you into the Docker environment, so that by the
end of it you have been able to configure the network as your will in some
Docker containers, as well as understanding basic Docker concepts.

**You don't need to know anything about Docker, nor read any
documentation**, as everything needed is provided here (and the work you did in
the previous lab sessions). However, to achieve a complete understanding, it is
recommended to extend your knowledge by reading some documentation and
understanding the source code that we will be using.

### Submission details

You need to deliver a PDF document containing an explanation of all the
**tasks** of this document. Note that **you don't need to document the
exercises**, as they're normally steps from the tutorial. Nevertheless, if you
don't complete them, you won't be able to follow this tutorial and the tasks.

## Docker installation

Docker can be installed in any machine, regarding of its OS. However, it's
recommended to use a GNU/Linux based OS, as this lab session has not been fully
tested on other Systems.

You can follow the updated installation tutorial at
[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Follow the steps to install Docker Desktop on your machine. If you use
GNU/Linux, you simply need to install it as every application:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
```

If you installed it via *apt*, you may not have the Desktop interface, but
**in this tutorial we will only use the CLI** (*Command-Line Interface*).

> **EXERCISE 1**
> 
> Install docker and docker-compose in your system. Note that
> docker-compose is included in the Docker Desktop application.

Once installed, and before you continue with this lab session, check that you
have everything installed. Here is what you should look for (Note that docker
needs the client and the server packages to work correctly).

```shell
$ docker version
Client: [...]
 Version: 20.10.22
 [...]
Server: [...]
 Engine:
  Version: 20.10.22
  [...]
$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.17.1, build unknown
[...]
```

Versions may change as time goes by, but as long as the CLI APIs don't change,
this tutorial should work correctly.

> **EXERCISE 2**
> 
> Check that your Docker installation was successful.

### Docker Hub Account

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is where Docker images are stored (as
public or private images). In this lab session we will need to pull some public
images from there. You shouldn't need to create an account in order to pull
them, but Docker policies could vary in the future.

Creating a Docker Hub account is the first step for getting more into Docker.
It's free, and will let you access more features (that aren't needed for this
lab session).

> **EXERCISE 3** (*Optional*)
> 
> Create a Docker Hub profile and log in to your CLI
> using `docker login -u <username>`.

## What is Docker?

The best way to define what is Docker, is to present the reason why it exists.

### The initial problem

Let's suppose the case of a computer that needs to run 5 different applications.

Each application needs its dependencies, and there may be incompatibilities
between the versions required for each app. One solution, using only one
physical machine, is to create 5 **virtual machines** and run one application
in every machine. That way, they run in a *isolated* world, where they have
their own dependencies and (maybe) different Kernel and OS.

However, it's hard to maintain a virtual machine: we would need to treat it as
a personal computer: update all the OS, long boot and shutdown times. But
mostly, **the resources of the physical machine would need to be shared out in
a fixed size**, meaning that at some point application 1 wouldn't need all its
resources and application 2 wouldn't keep up with the given resources.

### Virtualizing applications

Here's where Docker comes into our rescue. There're a lot of features that the
application doesn't need to run (i.e. a Desktop environment). It is possible to
create a "virtual machine" with just the necessary libraries for a desired
application. This will reduce resources and boot and shutdown times.

But that's not all: instead of booking some physical resources, let's run each
application in a host kernel's process. That way, resources can be shared by
the host machine. And this is what does Docker.

### Terminology

There are some words that are constantly repeated among Docker documentation
and this document. Let's define them in a few words:

- **Host machine**: The physical computer that will be running the containers.

- **Dockerfile**: The file that describes an image. Using an analogy, we could
  say that the Dockerfile is the Makefile of a project and the image is the
  executable file. It contains the instructions needed to recreate the image.

  You have an example of a `Dockerfile` in the repository of the lab session.

- **Image**: As said before, this can be compared to an executable file. When
  an image is run, a container is created.

- **Container**: A container is a kernel process that runs an image. As you can
  imagine, a container can be executed multiple times at once. **The changes
  made in a container will not affect the image.** This means that you can mess
  around with a container, that other containers or the image will remain
  intact, and **once you stop that container you will loose all changes**.

### Basic commands

Here is a list of the most basic commands that you may need in the first tasks:

- `docker build -t <image_name> <Dockerfile_folder>` will run the `Dockerfile`
  that's in the given folder, and save the image with the given name.

- `docker run [-it] <image_name>` will create a container of the image given.
  If the image runs an interactive application (i.e. bash), you will need to
  specify it with the `-it` flags.

  Docker implemented a feature that, if the image specified doesn't exist in the
  host machine, it will look for it in the Docker Hub repositories, download it
  and run it. This will save us (in our case) every `docker build` and
  `docker pull` command.

- `docker ps` lists the active containers and some information about them.

- `docker image ls` will list all locally saved images. You can remove them to
  save some memory space.

- `docker system prune -a` will delete **everything** you created using docker
  commands: networks, images, rules... this can be a good idea if you don't know
  what you just did. There are less heavy ways to fix things, but this will
  work every time.

There are a ton of commands, and some of them will be explained along this
document, but if you wish to have a cheat sheet you can check the official
documentation.

### Exercises and tasks

Now that you have some knowledge about Docker, let's play a little bit with it.

> **EXERCISE 4**
> 
> Run `docker run -it ubuntu`. The container's bash prompt will be
> displayed over the current terminal. In another terminal run `docker ps` to
> check the state of that terminal.

As you can see, the `ubuntu` image ([_/ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu))
contains a basic ubuntu distribution (the version could be specified i.e.
`docker run -it ubuntu:18.04`), **with the most basic commands**. Having only
the essential programs permits a lightweight image and faster boot times.

You can see that we are in another machine because the terminal prompt cas a
different host machine (remember: `user_name@computer_name`).

> **TASK 1**
> 
> In that container, check which commands do work properly:
> - `emacs test.txt`
> - `echo hola`
> - `nano test.txt`
> - `vi test.txt`
> - `ping google.com`
> - `ip a`
> - `sudo echo hola`
> 
> Did some of the results surprised you? Will it be able to perform tasks with
> these applications?

As you may imagine, we need to install some packages to run our applications.
For example, if we want to virtualize our Python script, we will need to install
it.

> **EXERCISE 5**
> 
> Run `apt list` and check if the nano package is listed blow.
> Remember that this list contains all the installable and installed packages.

The basic Ubuntu image comes with the smallest package list possible, again, to
use less resources. But in order to install a package, we need to add that entry
to the package list. Do you remember how we update the package list?

> **TASK 2**
> 
> Try to install nano (`apt install nano`). Did it work? Update the
> package list with `apt update`. Once this done, check `apt list`. Do you see
> it now?
> 
> Install it and try the nano command. Did it work?

Now we will verify the persistance of a container.

> **TASK 3**
> 
> Stop the current container by exiting its bash terminal. Check
> that nothing appears in `docker ps`, but the *Ubuntu* image still appears in
> `docker image ls`.
> 
> Run the container again, and check if `nano` is still installed. Did you expect
> that to happen? Why?

It will be painful to install everything every time we restart our container.
That's why we can create *Dockerfiles* that build an Ubuntu (or whatever) image
but with added applications. In fact, `ubuntu` is an image that sits on top of
the Docker's kernel (a *special* Linux kernel).

To make your life easier, an image has been already prepared for you. It's
called
[royalmo/docker-networks](https://hub.docker.com/r/royalmo/docker-networks).
You can find it's Dockerfile
[in this repository](https://github.com/royalmo/docker-networks), and it may be
recommended to read it in order to understand what contains the image, but it
isn't not mandatory.

> **TASK 4**
> 
> Run the `royalmo/docker-networks` image, and check which of the
> commands that didn't work in the first task now work. Do you have all the
> needed tools to configure the network?

## What is docker-compose?

Docker-compose is an extension to the docker environment that makes it easier to
manage multiple containers at once, and the connections between them. In our
case, we will use it to create multiple containers at once, and to connect them
as we wish.

### docker-compose commands

The `docker-compose` command will work *only* if it's executed in a folder where
a file named `docker-compose.yml` exists. We will not talk too much on what does
this file need, but rather on how to use it.

- `docker-compose up [-d]` will build images and run all containers. Use `-d`
  if some containers are interactive. This way it will run in background and you
  will be able to attach to the terminals later.

- `docker-compose down` will stop and delete all containers.

- `docker-compose ps` will show the state of the containers created. Please note
  that this command does a different thing than `docker ps`: *docker-compose*
  displays the services of the current `docker-compose.yml` (if they're up), and
  *docker* will show only the running containers.

- `docker attach <container_name>` will attach to the terminal, if possible, of
  the given container name. `<container_name>` must exist in `docker ps`.

- `docker-compose restart <service_name>` will restart a single service that may
  be stopped in `docker-compose ps`. A service can be stopped due to an error,
  the user exiting the shell, or with `docker stop`.

- If you found a *image not found error* when you run `docker-compose up`, it
  will probably be because you didn't run `docker-compose down`.
  **A docker-compose file can not be run multiple times.** If nothing is
  displayed in `docker-compose ps`, you're good to run *up*.

### Practical example

To sum up this section, let's practice a little bit. We will work with a basic
(but not minimal) `docker-compose.yml` that will contain this text:

```yml
version: "3.5"

services:
  node1:
    image: royalmo/docker-networks
    hostname: node1
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
  node2:
    image: ubuntu:22.04
    hostname: node2
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
```

> **EXERCISE 6**
> 
> Create a folder `test` and a file inside of it
> `docker-compose.yml` with the text provided above.

This is all the setup we need to do. Now, let's play with it!

> **TASK 5**
>
> Run the `docker-compose` setup **in background** (extra: what happen when
> you don't add the `-d` flag?). Check the status and the containers names with
> `docker-compose ps`. What are its states and container names?
>
> What would be the command to attach to a terminal?

Once the containers opened, we can check if everything works fine.

> **EXERCISE 7**
> 
> Open another terminal with 2 tabs (in bash you can create a tab with 
> *Ctrl+Shift+T*) and attach a container per tab. You can check that the
> bash prompt is different for each container.
> 
> Create a different file in each node with `touch`.

The last task of this section will be to restart a stopped container.

> **TASK 6**
> 
> Stop a container by exiting its shell. Does it appear now in `docker ps`?
> And in `docker-compose ps`? Do we have further info?
> 
> Restart only that container, and
> attach to it again. Does the file still exist?
> 
> What would happen if instead of restarting, you stop all containers with
> `docker-compose down` and restart them? You can verify your answer by trying
> it.

## Docker networking

Docker has a very complex but easy-to-understand network system in order to
permit containers to communicate with the outer world. When installed, it
creates it's own _isolated environment_.

The main and default Docker network is called `bridge`, and as it name tells,
it acts like a bridge between the containers and the host. New containers are
assigned with that address range. This means that, if we enable a NAT router on
our host machine, they will have internet access.

> **TASK 7**
> 
> On your host machine, run `ip a` and `ip routes`. You will see that Docker
> added some devices during its installation. What IP ranges do they use?
> Does your host machine know how to go to them (i.e. do they have it's own
> route entry)?
> 
> Now check the current *POSTROUTING* table (`sudo iptables -Lv -t nat`, and
> check the *POSTROUTING* section). Do you see something that could be doing
> a NAT router for the Docker containers?

### Network types

The bridge network type is only one of the four types that Docker has. Here you
have a small description of every type:

- **BRIDGE**: This is the most common network type, and the default for every
  new container. Every new network is simply a new sub-range of IP addresses 
  inside the default `127.0.0.0/8` sub-range. Of course, the addresses can be
  manually set. The bridge network also connects the containers with the host
  machine, as it also has an IP (which is normally the gateway).

- **HOST**: The *host* network simply runs the container with the network of
  the host. This means that it has the same IPs and routes. It's like we were
  running the application on the host machine, but the libraries and packages
  are isolated.

- **NONE**: This type of Docker network specifies that a container must not have
  any network attached into it. This can become very useful to protect our
  applications, so they don't have any external connections. We haven't
  mentioned it in this document, but Docker provides other inter-container
  communication methods, so we would still be able to control it.

- **OVERLAY**: This last network type is a little bit special. A swarm network
  is a "virtual network" that **is independent of the physical devices**. This
  means, that multiple devices can, together, have a single overlay network.
  This method becomes very useful when using distributed servers, and can be
  compared to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). By default, this networks
  are allocated in the `10.0.0.0/8` sub-range.

  We will just use this network type for educational purposes in a non-standard
  way, as we will have multiple overlay networks in a single physical computer.
  To be able to create overlay networks in this edge case, we need to initialize
  a special Docker feature: *swarm*. We will not get into what is swarm, don't
  worry!

- **MACVLAN**: The *macvlan* network creates a new connection to the host
  computer's main network. As this last sentence wasn't easy to understand,
  let's see an example. But don't worry, we won't see this in the exercises and
  tasks.

  Imagine your laptop is connected to the internet through WiFi (or Ethernet)
  with the IPv4 `192.168.1.5`. If a new container is attached to the *host*
  network, Docker will "try to connect a new device to your router", so that,
  for example, the new container's IPv4 address is `192.158.1.7`. You can set it
  up to use DHCP or a manual configuration.

> **EXERCISE 8**
> 
> Run `docker network ls` to see the default docker networks and its names.
> When a new network is created, you will see it here.

### Default network setup

As in a normal case we don't need any complex networking, Docker does a lot of
default things for us. For example, when a network is created, an IP range is
assigned, and when containers are added to it, an IP is automatically assigned.
Imagine how painful will it be to always connect to the network (with a
different IP) every time you start a new container!

Docker provides a feature to **inspect a network**. This can help us when
debugging, and will show us relevant information. The magic command is
`docker network inspect <network_name>`. This will result in a JSON object being
printed in our terminal (we could also save it to a file for better reading).
It will contain the IP range, the connected devices and its IPs, and other
metadata.

> **TASK 8**
> 
> With the compose file from the previous section running, inspect all networks
> available and note down each node's IP address. Verify your answers by running
> `ip a` on every node.

Docker also sets up the routes to all neighbors at the start of every new
container. This means that, if two containers are on the same network, they
will be able to ping each other without prior configuration.

But that's not all, Docker also provides a "DNS server", so you can put the
container name instead of its IP address, and it will replace it. However,
**this feature may not work if we change some network settings on-the-go**
(and surprise, this is what we will do!).

> **TASK 9**
> 
> Check with `ip route` if nodes can communicate to each other. Can they also
> communicate with the host machine? Which IP must they use to reach the host
> machine? Can all nodes reach Internet (i.e. google.com)?
> 
> Verify your answers by running the `ping` command. You can use the container's
> name instead of its IPv4.

If you look to some Docker tutorials, you may see that the only network-related
thing is to **expose a port**. Now that we know how docker connects each
container, what does this do? The answer is really simple: it adds a rule to
the host's *iptables*.

For example, "bind any inbound packets coming from WiFi and port 80 to the
docker container with IP `X` and the port 3000". As you can imagine, we could
do this by ourselves, but Docker does it for us.

> **EXERCISE 9**

>

### Managing docker networks

A good way to learn all the network stuff is to play with it. For this, you will
need some new docker commands. Here are some examples that you may need:

- `docker network create -d bridge --subnet 127.0.56.0/24 new_network_name` will
  create a new network of type *bridge* and the specified subnet and name.

- `docker run -it --network new_network_name royalmo/docker-networks` will run
  an image in a container with a specified network.

As you can see, Docker asks us to specify the subnet of a network. With a
physical Switch, this setup doesn't need to be done, but as we are
working in a virtualized environment, we need to add this extra information.
It's done this way so Docker can assign IPs automatically, and to add an extra
security barrier.

If you need to create a network with more options, check out this [reference
manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/)

> **TASK 10**
> 
> Imagine that we have a host computer (A) and a computer connected to the same
> LAN than the host (B). 
> - Port forwarding on A host machine is enabled. You did this in previous lab
>   sessions, do you remember how to do it?

> - The host (A) has a single container connected to that bridge network.
> - A and B must be able to ping each other, this means that this experiment may

>

## A complete exercise

Now that you know the essentials about docker, docker-compose and docker
networking, its time to apply it to simulate a real-life network.

A `docker-compose.yml` file has been prepared just for you. You don't need to
understand what's inside of it, but now that you know a lot about Docker it
could be an interesting exercise. You can see the file in this lab session's
[repository](https://github.com/royalmo/docker-networks) or in
[this direct link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/royalmo/docker-networks/main/docker-compose.yml)

> **EXERCISE 10**
> 
> Download the docker-compose file in a new folder called `docker_networks`
> and run it. This file will need to create overlay networks, so remember to
> initialize them the first time only with `docker swarm init`. Some warnings
> about swarm may appear while starting everything, don't worry, it's fine.
> 
> Once everything is up and running, attach to every node. Remember to use
> bash's tabs or another fancy terminal for ubuntu like *tilix*.

The nodes are connected with overlay networks. To prevent some headaches, a
schema is provided to you:

![network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49844173/210058483-d91a2f26-a27b-493f-958c-32e7b0f88467.png)

In the repository you will find a `.gv` file with the source code of this
schema. You will find it useful for the next task.

> **TASK 11**
> 
> Fill the graph with the subnets, container's IPs and container interface's
> names. That way, you will have all the names and IP needed at a single place.
> 
> **Warning!** Every time you restart the docker-compose, all addresses, ranges
> and configurations done on the nodes will be lost. It's recommended to do
> tasks 11, 12 and 13 as a pack, so you can use the results from the previous
> tasks. Pick a day you have plenty of time!
> 
> Add the updated graph to the report.

Now that we are familiarized with our node network, let's check its initial
state.

> **EXERCISE 11**
> 
> Check if *node1* has internet access (with a ping to google.com). Now check it
> for any other node. Try also to ping a neighbor, and a neighbor of a
> neighbor.

As you can see, there is a lot to do. But as we did this in previous lab
sessions, it should be done faster than expected.

However, you can see that there are multiple ways to reach some nodes. Be
careful with how you set up some routes, you may end up sending the packets
into an infinite loop (and loose them due to TTL)!

> **TASK 12**
> 
> By only changing the packet forwarding bit and the routing tables of every
> node (and maybe the host?), make that every node can communicate to every node
> **and** has internet access.
> 
> Explain the criteria you used to set up the routes (i.e. why did you chose to
> send packets through that way and not another).
> 
> You can check the results by repeating *Exercise 11*. Run also *tcpdump* on
> some nodes to check that the packets are going through the desired route.

If you finished the last task and all worked, congratulations! You finished this
lab session and learned something (hopefully).

For those that didn't have enough, an extra task has been prepared for you.
As with the *Task 12*, it's something you did in other lab sessions. Have fun!

> **TASK 13** (*Optional*)
> 
> Set up the node2 as a NAT router. Re-evaluate the routes (now some nodes
> won't be able to reach other nodes directly).
> 
> Verify that all works as expected by looking at ports and IP addresses in
> *tcpdump* output of the correct nodes.

## More information

If you wish to understand the files and commands used in this document,
you can check the official documentation, or look for some tutorials:

- [Dockerfile manual reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

- [docker-compose.yml manual reference](
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/)

As you can see, all of the settings can be done in a Dockerfile. This means
that we could create a *docker-compose* file with the correct images, such that
when we run `docker-compose up`, it starts all the nodes **and** sets up the
routes automatically.

But that is too much for a lab session, do it on your own and only if you
want! ;)
