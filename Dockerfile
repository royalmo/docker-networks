# Builds an Ubuntu image with some very basic tools to configure and test
# network connectivity.
#
# Build image with: `docker build -t docker-networks-img .`
# Note: You don't need to build this image manually.

# This file is overcommented for educational purposes

# All images start from some base image, in our case a fresh (and empty) Ubuntu.

# It is a good practice to tell who the maintainer is. Before it was done
# with `MANTAINER <name> <email>` but it's now depreceated.
LABEL maintainer="Eric Roy Almonacid <eric@ericroy.net>"
LABEL version="1.1"

# Here come the commands nedded to install everything we need.
# As each line can be cached, it's preferable to install one package per line.
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y apt-utils iproute2 iputils-ping iptables tcpdump nano

# This is the command that will be run AFTER the installation:
# - Commands starting with RUN are executed in `docker build`
# - The command (only one!) starting with CMD is executed at `docker run`.
CMD bash
# Stop (but not remove) the container by exiting bash.
